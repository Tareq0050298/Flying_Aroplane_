# Flying_Aeroplane_
Assalamualaikum everyone! Here I have uploaded my OpenGL project : Flying Aroplane.Typecally  the significance of this  project is how a palne fly over the particular angle cordinates.Body shape of Plane is rectangular and cockpit was designed by two colours(Gray with Red).It wings was designed as well.Basically You will see three types layer of roads(Black,White and Blue) which were made using c++ codes. This is an amazing demonstration of the beautiful c++ codes. It shows how anyone can show beautiful colors and brilliant logic in a C++ project. In order to know how this works you must have the idea about the language C++.

**About function**
*void drawStar() and void drawSolar()

glColor3f(): Can be called in between glBegin and glEnd, when it is used this way. It can be used to give each vertex its own color. The resulting rectangle is then shaded with an attractive color gradient.

glVertex3f(): It has three floating point, which is considered as x,y and z. It determines where the vertex is in space.

glEnable(): It enable to plug in colors you want to enter in it.

glTranslatef(): The glTranslatef function multiplies the current matrix by a translation matrix.

glutSolidSphere(): The glutSolidSphere() function draws a shaded sphere centered at the origin. The surface is created from quadrangles (except for triangles as degenerate quads at the poles) in a longitude/latitude pattern. The equatorial great circle lies in the xy-plane and is centered on the origin.
glRotatef(): The glRotatef function computes a matrix that performs a counterclockwise rotation of angle degrees about the vector from the origin through the point (x, y, z).
